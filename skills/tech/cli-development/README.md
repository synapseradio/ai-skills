# cli-development

CLI development reference grounded in [clig.dev](https://clig.dev), the
open-source [Command Line Interface
Guidelines](https://github.com/cli-guidelines/cli-guidelines) by Aanand
Prasad, Ben Firshman, Carl Tashian, and Eva Parish. Use it whenever you
are designing, reviewing, modifying, or specifying a command-line
interface and want concrete, citable guidance.

The skill ships a sitemap of every clig.dev section anchor plus local
reference copies of each section, and instructs the agent to fetch the
canonical source from clig.dev (via `https://clig.dev/llms.txt`) before
binding recommendations to quoted text — so the citations track the
upstream guide as it evolves.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/synapseradio/ai-skills
```

Or copy `skills/cli-development/` into `~/.claude/skills/cli-development/`.

## Usage

The skill triggers on natural language about CLI work. No special
invocation is needed; mention CLI design, flag conventions, help text,
exit codes, error messages, environment variables, naming, or any
related topic and the skill will load.

Examples:

- "Review the flag layout in this PR."
- "Should I use `-q` or `--quiet` for this option?"
- "Where should this tool store its config — XDG, env, or both?"
- "We need to deprecate `--legacy`. What is the right rollout?"
- "Help me name this CLI."
- "Write the help text for `myapp deploy`."

## How it works

The skill points at clig.dev as the source of truth. When invoked, it:

1. Reads [`references/sitemap.md`](references/sitemap.md) to identify which sections of
   clig.dev apply to the task — usually one to four.
2. Fetches the live canonical text from `https://clig.dev/llms.txt`
   using the `tavily-extract` skill (preferred) or `WebFetch`. The
   bundled per-section files act as offline fallback.
3. Translates the relevant rule into a concrete recommendation, code
   change, or review comment, with the matching anchor URL cited
   inline (e.g., `https://clig.dev/#arguments-and-flags`).

Out of scope: full-screen terminal programs (vim, emacs, ncurses
TUIs), and language-specific framework idioms — clig.dev is explicit
that it does not cover these.
