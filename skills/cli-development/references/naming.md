The name of your program is particularly important on the CLI: your
users will be typing it all the time, and it needs to be easy to
remember and type.

**Make it a simple, memorable word.** But not too generic, or you'll
step on the toes of other commands and confuse users. For example,
both ImageMagick and Windows used the command `convert`.

**Use only lowercase letters, and dashes if you really need to.**
`curl` is a good name, `DownloadURL` is not.

**Keep it short.** Users will be typing it all the time. Don't make it
_too_ short: the very shortest commands are best reserved for the
common utilities used all the time, such as `cd`, `ls`, `ps`.

**Make it easy to type.** If you expect people to type your command
name all day, make it easy on their hands.

A real-world example: long before Docker Compose was `docker compose`,
it was
[`plum`](https://github.com/aanand/fig/blob/0eb7d308615bae1ad4be1ca5112ac7b6b6cbfbaf/setup.py#L26).
This turned out to be such an awkward, one-handed hopscotch that it
was immediately renamed to
[`fig`](https://github.com/aanand/fig/commit/0cafdc9c6c19dab2ef2795979dc8b2f48f623379),
which – as well as being shorter – flows much more easily.
