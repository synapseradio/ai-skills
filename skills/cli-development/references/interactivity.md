**Only use prompts or interactive elements if `stdin` is an interactive
terminal (a TTY).** This is a pretty reliable way to tell whether
you're piping data into a command or whether it's being run in a
script, in which case a prompt won't work and you should throw an
error telling the user what flag to pass.

**If `--no-input` is passed, don't prompt or do anything interactive.**
This allows users an explicit way to disable all prompts in commands.
If the command requires input, fail and tell the user how to pass the
information as a flag.

**If you're prompting for a password, don't print it as the user types.**
This is done by turning off echo in the terminal. Your language should
have helpers for this.

**Let the user escape.** Make it clear how to get out. (Don't do what
vim does.) If your program hangs on network I/O etc, always make
Ctrl-C still work. If it's a wrapper around program execution where
Ctrl-C can't quit (SSH, tmux, telnet, etc), make it clear how to do
that. For example, SSH allows escape sequences with the `~` escape
character.
