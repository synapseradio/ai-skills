If you've got a tool that's sufficiently complex, you can reduce its
complexity by making a set of subcommands. If you have several tools
that are very closely related, you can make them easier to use and
discover by combining them into a single command (for example, RCS vs.
Git).

They're useful for sharing stuff — global flags, help text,
configuration, storage mechanisms.

**Be consistent across subcommands.** Use the same flag names for the
same things, have similar output formatting, etc.

**Use consistent names for multiple levels of subcommand.** If a
complex piece of software has lots of objects and operations that can
be performed on those objects, it is a common pattern to use two
levels of subcommand for this, where one is a noun and one is a verb.
For example, `docker container create`. Be consistent with the verbs
you use across different types of objects.

Either `noun verb` or `verb noun` ordering works, but `noun verb`
seems to be more common.

**Don't have ambiguous or similarly-named commands.** For example,
having two subcommands called "update" and "upgrade" is quite
confusing. You might want to use different words, or disambiguate with
extra words.
