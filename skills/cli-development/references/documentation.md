The purpose of [help text](https://clig.dev/#help) is to give a brief,
immediate sense of what your tool is, what options are available, and
how to perform the most common tasks. Documentation, on the other hand,
is where you go into full detail. It's where people go to understand
what your tool is for, what it _isn't_ for, how it works and how to do
everything they might need to do.

**Provide web-based documentation.** People need to be able to search
online for your tool's documentation, and to link other people to
specific parts. The web is the most inclusive documentation format
available.

**Provide terminal-based documentation.** Documentation in the terminal
has several nice properties: it's fast to access, it stays in sync with
the specific installed version of the tool, and it works without an
internet connection.

**Consider providing man pages.** [man
pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page), Unix's original system
of documentation, are still in use today, and many users will
reflexively check `man mycmd` as a first step when trying to learn
about your tool. To make them easier to generate, you can use a tool
like [ronn](http://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/ronn.1.html) (which can also
generate your web docs).

However, not everyone knows about `man`, and it doesn't run on all
platforms, so you should also make sure your terminal docs are
accessible via your tool itself. For example, `git` and `npm` make
their man pages accessible via the `help` subcommand, so `npm help ls`
is equivalent to `man npm-ls`.
