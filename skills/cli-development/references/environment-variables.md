**Environment variables are for behavior that _varies with the context_
in which a command is run.** The "environment" of an environment
variable is the terminal session — the context in which the command
is running. So, an env var might change each time a command runs, or
between terminal sessions on one machine, or between instantiations of
one project across several machines.

Environment variables may duplicate the functionality of flags or
configuration parameters, or they may be distinct from those things.
See [Configuration](https://clig.dev/#configuration) for a breakdown
of common types of configuration and recommendations on when
environment variables are most appropriate.

**For maximum portability, environment variable names must only
contain uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores (and mustn't start
with a number).** Which means `O_O` and `OWO` are the only emoticons
that are also valid environment variable names.

**Aim for single-line environment variable values.** While multi-line
values are possible, they create usability issues with the `env`
command.

**Avoid commandeering widely used names.** Here's a [list of POSIX
standard env
vars](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap08.html).

**Check general-purpose environment variables for configuration
values when possible:**

- `NO_COLOR`, to disable color (see
  [Output](https://clig.dev/#output)) or `FORCE_COLOR` to enable it
  and ignore the detection logic
- `DEBUG`, to enable more verbose output
- `EDITOR`, if you need to prompt the user to edit a file or input
  more than a single line
- `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY`, if you're
  going to perform network operations (The HTTP library you're using
  might already check for these.)
- `SHELL`, if you need to open up an interactive session of the user's
  preferred shell (If you need to execute a shell script, use a
  specific interpreter like `/bin/sh`)
- `TERM`, `TERMINFO` and `TERMCAP`, if you're going to use
  terminal-specific escape sequences
- `TMPDIR`, if you're going to create temporary files
- `HOME`, for locating configuration files
- `PAGER`, if you want to automatically page output
- `LINES` and `COLUMNS`, for output that's dependent on screen size
  (e.g. tables)

**Read environment variables from `.env` where appropriate.** If a
command defines environment variables that are unlikely to change as
long as the user is working in a particular directory, then it should
also read them from a local `.env` file so users can configure it
differently for different projects without having to specify them
every time. Many languages have libraries for reading `.env` files
([Rust](https://crates.io/crates/dotenv),
[Node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv),
[Ruby](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv)).

**Don't use `.env` as a substitute for a proper [configuration
file](https://clig.dev/#configuration).** `.env` files have a lot of
limitations:

- A `.env` file is not commonly stored in source control
- (Therefore, any configuration stored in it has no history)
- It has only one data type: string
- It lends itself to being poorly organized
- It makes encoding issues easy to introduce
- It often contains sensitive credentials & key material that would be
  better stored more securely

If it seems like these limitations will hamper usability or security,
then a dedicated config file might be more appropriate.

**Do not read secrets from environment variables.** While environment
variables may be convenient for storing secrets, they have proven too
prone to leakage:

- Exported environment variables are sent to every process, and from
  there can easily leak into logs or be exfiltrated
- Shell substitutions like
  `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN"` will leak into
  globally-readable process state. (cURL offers the `-H @filename`
  alternative for reading sensitive headers from a file.)
- Docker container environment variables can be viewed by anyone with
  Docker daemon access via `docker inspect`
- Environment variables in systemd units are globally readable via
  `systemctl show`

Secrets should only be accepted via credential files, pipes,
`AF_UNIX` sockets, secret management services, or another IPC
mechanism.
