There are a few basic rules you need to follow. Get these wrong, and
your program will be either very hard to use, or flat-out broken.

**Use a command-line argument parsing library where you can.** Either
your language's built-in one, or a good third-party one. They will
normally handle arguments, flag parsing, help text, and even spelling
suggestions in a sensible way.

**Return zero exit code on success, non-zero on failure.** Exit codes
are how scripts determine whether a program succeeded or failed, so you
should report this correctly. Map the non-zero exit codes to the most
important failure modes.

**Send output to `stdout`.** The primary output for your command should
go to `stdout`. Anything that is machine readable should also go to
`stdout` — this is where piping sends things by default.

**Send messaging to `stderr`.** Log messages, errors, and so on should
all be sent to `stderr`. This means that when commands are piped
together, these messages are displayed to the user and not fed into the
next command.
