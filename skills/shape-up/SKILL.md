description: >-
  Conversational software requirements elicitation producing shaped
  specifications. This skill should be used when the user asks to "write a
  spec", "create requirements", "spec this out", "what should we build",
  "define the requirements", "help me think through this system", "spec
  out a feature", "shape this project", "requirements gathering",
  "write a pitch", "help me figure out what to build", or when a user
  describes a software need that requires structured requirements before
  implementation begins.

# Shape Up

Drive a structured elicitation conversation, then produce a shaped
specification as a plan-mode artifact. The conversation surfaces intent;
the artifact encodes it for implementation.

Influenced by [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) (Basecamp/Ryan
Singer): appetite-first framing, solution at element level, explicit
rabbit holes and no-gos. The output is a pitch — rough, solved, and
bounded — not an exhaustive SRS.

## Two Phases

Track progress through elicitation, gate check, and specification using
available task tracking tools.

**Phase 1 — Elicitation.** Open-ended dialogue where Claude drives —
synthesizing, probing, illustrating with inline diagrams, and using
AskUserQuestion for structured trade-off decisions. Surfaces six elements
through natural conversation following the shaping process: set boundaries,
find elements, address risks, converge.

**Phase 2 — Specification.** Enter plan mode and write the shaped spec as
the plan file. Nothing from Phase 1 survives as conversational residue.
The artifact stands alone.

## Context Loading

Load references only when the current phase needs them.

| Phase | Load | Do NOT Load |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Elicitation (opening) | `references/elicitation-guide.md` | all others |
| Elicitation (after first exchange) | `references/audience-adaptation.md` | gate-checklist, spec-production |
| Elicitation (complex/vague problems) | `references/shaping-techniques.md` | gate-checklist, spec-production |
| Elicitation (entities emerge) | `references/domain-modeling.md` | gate-checklist, spec-production |
| Gate check | `references/gate-checklist.md` | elicitation-guide, spec-production |
| Specification | `references/spec-production.md` | elicitation-guide, gate-checklist |

Multiple elicitation references can be loaded concurrently as the
conversation evolves. Only load what the conversation actually needs.

## Phase 1: Elicitation

Load `references/elicitation-guide.md` and follow its protocol.

The elicitation conversation surfaces six elements:

1. **Problem** — one specific story showing the broken status quo. Who is
   affected, what happens today without this system.
2. **Appetite** — time budget and what it implies about scope. Not an
   estimate — a deliberate choice about how much this is worth.
3. **Solution** — named elements with responsibilities. Key interaction
   flows at fat-marker level — concrete enough to build from, rough enough
   to leave room.
4. **Rabbit Holes** — specific risks identified and patched with upfront
   decisions. Technical unknowns flagged for spikes.
5. **No-Gos** — explicit exclusions that prevent scope creep during
   building. Sharper than "out of scope."
6. **Boundaries** — non-functional constraints, must-haves vs.
   nice-to-haves, success criteria measured against the baseline.

**Stakeholders** emerge naturally within Problem. **Domain** loads
on-demand via `references/domain-modeling.md` for complex problems.
**Acceptance criteria** are embedded in Boundaries as success vs. baseline.

### Audience calibration

After the first substantive exchange, load `references/audience-adaptation.md`.
Detect whether the user is a customer, engineer, or PM from their language
and framing — not from their title. Adapt vocabulary, visualization style,
and emphasis accordingly. Re-calibrate when signals shift.

### Shaping flow

1. **Opening** — understand the raw idea: what is broken, who cares, what
   prompted this
2. **Set boundaries** — surface appetite and no-gos early. The appetite
   constrains everything downstream.
3. **Find the elements** — named components and interaction flows, not
   feature lists. Load `references/shaping-techniques.md` for complex
   or vague problems.
4. **Address risks** — actively probe for rabbit holes. Load
   `references/domain-modeling.md` when entities and invariants emerge.
5. **Converge** — notice when questions stop producing new information.
   State this observation explicitly.

### Exit conditions

Apply all three, in order:

1. **Convergence detection.** Notice when answers confirm rather than add.
   State this observation explicitly.
2. **Gate check.** Load `references/gate-checklist.md`. Validate every
   gate. Present pass/fail to the user.
3. **Explicit approval.** Halt and request confirmation before producing
   the spec. Never proceed without the user's "go."

## Phase 2: Specification

Load `references/spec-production.md`.

Enter plan mode. Write the shaped specification as the plan file following
the pitch template. The artifact must stand alone — no conversational
residue from Phase 1.

Exit plan mode for user review.

### Scaling

- **Small feature:** Problem + Appetite + Solution + No-Gos. Light
  Boundaries. Skip Domain.
- **Medium project:** Full template.
- **Large system:** Full template with solution elements grouped by area.

## Rules

1. **Elicitation is a conversation, not a form.** Explore, reflect, let
   the user correct. Do not interrogate with an element checklist.
2. **Never produce the spec without explicit approval.** Gate checklist
   is necessary but not sufficient. The user's confirmation is the
   hard stop.
3. **Claude drives.** Synthesize, propose, probe. Not "what else?" but
   "Based on X, I think Y — is that right?"
4. **Conversation content is ephemeral.** Explanations, diagrams,
   AskUserQuestion interactions do NOT appear in the spec artifact.
5. **Adapt to the audience, not the role.** Detect from language,
   re-calibrate when signals shift.
6. **Do not solve during elicitation.** Surface elements and flows,
   not architecture. "Handle 10K users" is a boundary. "Use Redis"
   is a solution.
7. **Make the implicit explicit.** Name implied requirements: "That
   implies authentication — should we include it or is that a
   rabbit hole?"
8. **Use AskUserQuestion only for structured trade-offs.** Appetite
   sizing, priority resolution, boundary decisions, risk patching.
9. **Appetite before solution.** Always surface how much this is worth
   before exploring what to build.
