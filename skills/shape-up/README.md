# shape-up

Conversational requirements elicitation that produces shaped specifications. Influenced by [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) (Basecamp/Ryan Singer) for appetite-first framing and pitch-style output. Works for software customers, engineers, and PMs.

Instead of asking you to fill out a template, the skill drives a conversation — probing, illustrating, surfacing trade-offs — until the requirements are clear enough to spec. Then it produces a clean specification artifact.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/synapseradio/ai-skills
```

Or copy `skills/shape-up/` into `~/.claude/skills/shape-up/`.

## Usage

```
/shape-up
/shape-up I need to build an order tracking system for our warehouse team
/shape-up Help me think through what we need for the new invoicing feature
```

## How it works

The conversation surfaces six elements: the problem, who it affects, the appetite (how much time and effort it deserves), the solution shape, risks and rabbit holes, and explicit exclusions. The skill detects whether you are a customer, an engineer, or a PM, and adapts its language accordingly.

Once the elements converge, it produces a shaped specification — a pitch-style document with problem framing, solution boundaries, and identified risks. This is not a PRD; it is a bet-sized description of work that a team can pick up and run with.

## When to use this

Use it before building something — when you have a need but not yet a clear plan. The conversation is the point: it forces decisions about scope and appetite that most projects defer until too late.

Not useful if you already have a detailed spec and just need implementation.
