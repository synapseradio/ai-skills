# shell-testing

Write idiomatic [BATS](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) tests for bash and zsh shell scripts. Covers test patterns, assertions, mocking, isolation, zsh-specific testing, and CI integration.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/synapseradio/ai-skills
```

Or copy `skills/shell-testing/` into `~/.claude/skills/shell-testing/`.

## Usage

```
/shell-testing write tests for lib/helpers.sh
/shell-testing add integration tests for the install command
```

## What it covers

- BATS-core patterns with bats-assert, bats-support, and bats-file
- Mandatory test isolation (temp dirs, mocked externals, safety guards)
- Zsh testing via `bats --shell zsh` and zunit
- Mocking strategies: function overrides, PATH manipulation, CLI stubs
- Targeted test execution — runs only the tests that matter, not the full suite

## Why use this instead of prompting?

Shell testing has sharp edges. A plain prompt will write tests that pass locally but fail in CI, leak state between runs, or silently skip assertions because of quoting bugs. This skill loads the specific gotchas — dangerous teardown patterns, negation bugs, variable scope differences between bash and zsh — so the tests are correct from the start.
