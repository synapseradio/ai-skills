# communicate

Helps written prose actually reach the person on the other end. The skill works across five dimensions of communication — purpose, clarity, integrity, shape, depth — with two cross-cutting concerns that ride along regardless: rhetorical tradition (so Anglo-American conventions do not silently become the unmarked default) and AI slop (the lexical, structural, and voice patterns that mark prose as machine-shaped).

Every use begins by interrogating the request across all five dimensions. The skill then loads at least one reference per dimension — a floor of five — plus the two cross-cutting files, choosing each because the diagnostic pointed at it rather than to fill a quota. The reference set lives in [`references/`](references/), and the skill body decides which to consult based on what the prose is doing.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/synapseradio/ai-skills
```

Or copy `skills/communicate/` into `~/.claude/skills/communicate/`.

## Usage

The skill triggers on natural language about prose work — composing, proofreading, redrafting, adapting, phrasing — so an explicit invocation is not required. When you want to invoke it directly:

```
/communicate fix the passive voice in this paragraph and strengthen the hedging
```

```
/communicate proofread this draft before I send it
```

```
/communicate help me write the introduction for this proposal
```

```
/communicate adapt this passage for a US business audience without flattening it
```

```
/communicate in Portuguese we say saudade — how do I render that in English without breaking it?
```

## How it works

Every invocation begins with two pre-flight checks: the **tradition lens** (what rhetorical convention is the writing operating inside, and is the model about to silently normalize toward Anglo-American defaults) and the **slop audit** (does the prose carry the lexical, structural, voice, or casual-context tells of AI output, regardless of who wrote it).

After that, the skill works every one of the five dimensions, choosing the reference within each that this request calls for:

- **Purpose** — does the shape of the piece do the job it's here to do, does it meet the reader where they are, does it bridge unfamiliar concepts.
- **Clarity** — can the reader follow it; are actors visible; does language commit or cushion; do abstractions have grounding.
- **Integrity** — does the certainty match the evidence; are scope and boundaries explicit; are silent premises surfaced.
- **Shape** — is there tension and pull, are sections ordered to build, does sentence cadence vary, does the prose read as written by someone speaking from somewhere.
- **Depth** — what do the claims carry that goes unsaid; are conflated concerns separated; does the prose open inquiry or close it.

Each reference file is a self-contained instruction. The skill picks the most fitting one in each dimension as its floor, and reaches for more within a dimension as the drafts develop.

## When to use this

Use it when the writing matters: proposals, documentation, PR descriptions, anything that will be read more than once or by someone outside the immediate team. It is also useful when writing in English from a non-English thinking language, or when adapting prose across rhetorical traditions.

For throwaway messages or scratch notes, just write — the skill is for prose that has to land.
