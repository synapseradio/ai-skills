# Avoid Slop

Strict laws, not heuristics. Cushioning produces cushioning; this file prescribes.

Load when drafting any prose, when proofreading, when the prose risks reading as machine-paced regardless of who wrote it.

## Lexical tells — cut on sight

The Kobak et al. (2024) PubMed analysis identified words that surged in academic writing after late 2022. Cut these unless the technical sense is exact:

| Slop | Use instead |
|------|-------------|
| delve into | look at, examine |
| intricate | complex, detailed |
| realm | field, area |
| pivotal | key, central |
| underscore | emphasize, show |
| tapestry | mix, range |
| commendable | solid |
| meticulous | careful, exact |
| robust | strong, reliable |
| seamless | smooth, easy |
| navigate (a topic) | work through, handle |
| foster | encourage, build |
| leverage | use |
| transformative | reshapes, changes |
| illuminate | show, clarify |
| harness | use |
| embark | start, begin |
| cultivate | build, grow |
| embrace | take up, accept |
| glean | find, learn |

Add adjacent slop: *crucial*, *vital*, *essential*, *paramount* used as default intensifiers; *dynamic* applied to anything that moves; *holistic* applied to anything more than one part.

## Transitional-phrase law

**Maximum one transitional phrase per 100 words.** Most paragraphs need none.

Cut on sight:

- It's worth noting that…
- It's important to note that…
- It should be mentioned that…
- In conclusion
- In essence
- Ultimately
- At its core
- Furthermore
- Moreover
- Additionally
- Consequently
- Thus

The connection a transitional phrase claims usually exists in the sentence order. If it doesn't, fix the order, not the transition.

## Structural tells — forbidden as defaults

Each structure below is allowed only when it does specific work the prose needs. Defaulting to it without need is slop.

- **Tricolon-as-default.** Lists default to three items because the model finds three. Use 2, 4, or 5 when those are the actual count. Two related items are a pair. Five distinct items are five.
- **False balance** ("on one hand … on the other"). Forbidden when the balance is invented for symmetry. If one side is right, say so.
- **Conclusion-restating paragraph.** A paragraph that says "in essence" what the piece already said. Cut the paragraph.
- **Bullet lists when prose carries the thought.** Lists are for items that are genuinely parallel. Heterogeneous items in a list are prose pretending to be parallel.
- **Symmetric paragraph shapes.** Three consecutive paragraphs with identical topic-sentence-then-three-examples-then-summary architecture is broken. Vary.

## Intransitive-form constructions — forbidden

These are slot-fillable templates whose meaning does not change when you swap the noun. The shape carries the sentence; the subject barely constrains it. That is the slop signature. The fix in every case: state what the thing does. If the sentence still works with a different noun in the slot, cut it.

- **"The ___ is real."** Forbidden. Calling a thing "real" adds nothing — its existence is presupposed by mentioning it. The phrase performs emphasis instead of providing it. Examples: "the burnout is real," "the threat is real," "the opportunity is real." Replace with what makes the thing matter — the specific cost, the specific stake, the specific evidence.
- **"The ___ is the signal."** Forbidden. The construction promises a reframe — *your assumption was wrong, here is the hidden truth* — and almost always delivers an ordinary observation in epiphany clothes. It also closes inquiry: once the signal has been named, no further investigation is invited. Replace with the mechanism: what does the thing indicate, and how does the indication work?
- **Negation-then-affirmation as default cadence.** "X is Y, not Z." "It is not Y, it is Z." "It's not just Y — it's Z." Forbidden unless the reader genuinely held the negated view. Otherwise the negation is a strawman and the affirmation rides its momentum without earning the contrast. Replace with the affirmation alone. If a contrast is needed, name a position someone actually held and engage it.

Why these three are a coherent class: each works by gesturing at insight without supplying one. The reader recognizes the shape from marketing copy, viral threads, and AI output, and infers — correctly — that the writer reached for cadence instead of meaning. This is the specific revulsion humans feel toward AI prose. The shape announces itself before the content arrives.

## Voice tells — forbidden

- **The corporate-neutral voice.** Sounds like a corporate communications email regardless of context. Replace with the actual register the situation calls for.
- **Hedge-stacks.** "Might potentially possibly," "could perhaps suggest." Pick one hedge or none.
- **Closing exhortations.** "Embrace the journey," "let's explore," "let's dive in." Cut.
- **Faux-personal openers.** "I've been thinking about…" Just say the thing.
- **"Great question!" / "Excellent point!" preambles.** Cut. Answer the question.
- **Editorial we** in single-author work. Use "I" or recast in the impersonal.

## Casual-context tells — forbidden in chat, comments, short replies

Slop has a different signature in casual register. Each forbidden:

- **Over-formal helpfulness in casual contexts.** "I'd be happy to help with that!" → cut. "Got it" beats "Thanks for letting me know!"
- **"Here's the thing:" preamble.** Cut.
- **TL;DR on messages under 200 words.** A summary of two sentences is one sentence too many.
- **Over-balanced refusal to take a position.** In Slack or comments, asking for an opinion and getting "well, it depends on many factors" is slop. Take the position the situation asks for.
- **Performative emoji signaling.** 🚨 to mark "important," 🧵 to mark "thread," 💯 to agree. The text carries the signal.
- **Asking permission to begin.** "I'll go ahead and…" → just go ahead and.

## Audit diagnostics — laws

Compute these on the draft before delivery. Each is a hard rule, not a target.

- **Sentence-length coefficient of variation (CV) per paragraph: > 0.5.** Below 0.3 is broken; rewrite.
- **Paragraph-length CV across the piece: > 0.4.** Three consecutive paragraphs within ±20% length is broken.
- **Kobak-vocabulary density: ≤ 1 per 1,000 words in non-technical prose; 0 in casual prose.**
- **Transitional-phrase ratio: ≤ 1 per 100 words.**
- **Em-dash density: ≤ 1 per paragraph.** Each em-dash must do interruption or pivot work.
- **Bullet-list ratio: ≤ 1 list per 200 words of prose.**
- **First-person-plural in single-author work: 0** unless the writer is explicitly speaking for a group.
- **Type-token ratio across paragraphs: must vary.** Near-flat ratio profiles are broken.
- **Fragment audit: each fragment must read as the previous full sentence's continuation.** If it does not, it is a typo.
- **Parataxis/hypotaxis ratio: matched to register.** All-paratactic reads as wire copy / Hemingway. All-hypotactic reads as Faulkner / academic. Mismatch is broken.

## Equity caveat

Liang et al. (2023, Cell Press *Patterns*) tested seven detectors on essays written by non-native English speakers. 61% of essays were flagged as AI-generated. The mechanism: ESL writers draw from a smaller, more frequent vocabulary — exactly the signal detectors equate with machine generation.

The audit diagnostics above use the same signals. Apply them to the model's own output. Do not apply them to judge another writer.

## Counter-pattern: what cared-for prose does

- Variance in sentence length, motivated by what the long and short sentences are doing.
- A specific verb where a generic one would land — "snapped" not "moved," "built" not "leveraged."
- A position taken when the situation asks for one. Refusal is a position; "it depends" without naming the dependency is not.
- One transitional phrase where the prose genuinely changes direction. None where it doesn't.
- An em-dash that interrupts or pivots. A colon that announces. A comma everywhere else.
- A paragraph that ends when the thought ends — not at three sentences, not at five, at the thought.

## NEVER

- Never apply these audit laws to judge another writer. Liang et al. is fact, not hedge.
- Never preserve a transitional phrase because it sounds polished. Polish that adds nothing is slop.
- Never use a Kobak word because it sounds professional. Professionalism is precision, not vocabulary.
- Never close with an exhortation. The work closes the piece, not the verb "embrace."
- Never default to three items. Choose the count the situation has.
